# This action fetches the latest version of QGIS, builds it, and extracts the
# Python components into a new branch.
# It then performs basic cleanup and automated fixes in additional commits and
# finally creates a PR with the updated type stubs.
#
# Manual review and tidying up is usually required before merging.
